# 🏥 Health Insurance Premium Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the insurance premium cost for individuals based on personal health and demographic attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more.

> Built as part of a hands-on ML workflow to demonstrate model development, experimentation, and deployment for real-world use cases.

---

## 📊 Features

- Trains a regression model (Linear Regression) to estimate premium costs
- Supports experimentation and reproducibility via helper functions
- Cleans and preprocesses dataset using pandas
- Modular structure for easy reuse and extensibility
